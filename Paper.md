# Introduction

Computers have been becoming increasingly integral to everyday life over the past half century. The advent of smartphones has made computer technology more accessible and mobile. They have transformed the way we interact with society: making it easier to commuicate with individuals, and making it easier to share and view content on social networks. Over the next couple decades, we can expect new technologies such as driverless cars and augemented/virtual reality to cause a similarly significant fundamental change to the way we go about our daily lives. Two foundational fields of computer science that are integral to those new technologies are computer visiona and machine learning. 

Computer vision and machine learning were both born in the 1960s with major foundational developments taking place through 1970s [@wiki_cv; @forbes_ml].
